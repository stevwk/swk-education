This GitHub organization is a "folder" of repositories for most programmatic coursework completed during my bachelor's degree in computer science. In addition to providing a means of organization and version control for my academic work, the repository also archives school programming projects and online recreational courses undertaken. Through this collection, one may gain an understanding of the topics explored and studied during my academic and personal endeavors in computer science.
